## Overview

Portfolio page is a webpage including various elements i.e. images, buttons, links etc. To make this webpage, HTML, CSS is used. This project mainly focuses on implementation of header, main, section, div, img, ul, li, footer tag of HTML and CSS flexbox and responsive web design elements. 

Website is divided into 5 webpages having details for About me, Career Summary, Projects, Acadmics Transcript and Contact

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Project Description
a. I chose this project to test my skill on HTML basic elements, CSS layout and to apply media query property. I used flexbox for CSS layout.

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

Media query is used to make webpage responsive by adding a breakpoint according to different screen sizes. It is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

b. I have used HTML and CSS to build this website.

c. I had implemented some of the featues including;-
   - css flexbox is used for designing the website layout.
   - css media queries is used to make the page responsive on multiple devices.

## My process

- I started with structuring website using HTML. Considered one page at a time and added CSS properties for that page.
Main elements in HTML are : 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  ........
</head>

<body>
  <header>
    .........
  </header>

  <main>
    ........
  </main>

  <footer>
    ........
  </footer>
</body>
</html>

- CSS properties I have used are width, margin, padding, display, media queries, hover, color, background, align, border etc.
- Respective page background are applied.
- For span of the differnt sections grid-template-columns, border-box property is used.
- For responsiveness media query is used.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries for responsiveness

### What I learned

I have learnt the best practice to write html code using header, main, and footer, sections and div tag in main, use of span tag. Use of div tag to divide different sections of web page.

In CSS, I learnt mostly to build a perfect layout using css flexbox, use of margin and padding to align html elements and use of media queries to make page responsive.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

html
<section class="two">
      <img src="images/image-computer.png" alt="/images/image-computer.png">
      <div class="features">
        <div>
          <h3>Quick Search</h3>
          <span>Easily search your snippets by content, category, web address, application, and more.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="features">
          <h3>iCloud Sync</h3>
          <span>Instantly saves and syncs snippets across all your devices.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="features">
          <h3>Complete History</h3>
          <span>Retrieve any snippets from the first moment you started using the app.</span>
        </div>
      </div>
  </section>

css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* for mobile screens*/
@media (max-width: 730px){

}



### Continued development

- CSS flexbox is layout module, I can learn it better by applying it in more projects. 
- I learnt layout and CSS flexbox use to make layout easily according to need, I will explore more onto it.
- media queries was very new to implement, now I will implement it for various device screens in future projects.


### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp) - This helped me for implementation of css grid, flexbox, padding, margin, width and box-sizing concept. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand media queries impelmentation to provide responsiveness for different screens. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
